Cryptocurrency price prediction by sentiment analysis.

Facilitation of Cryptocurrency Price Prediction by Sentiment Analysis
Project Description
Cryptocurrency is a dynamic and rapidly changing market, making it difficult for investors to make informed decisions. Sentiment analysis has emerged as a promising tool for analyzing the emotional tone behind news articles, social media posts, and other online content related to cryptocurrency. In this project, we aim to explore the use of sentiment analysis to facilitate cryptocurrency trading decisions. To achieve this goal, we scraped data from various news articles and collected price data for several cryptocurrencies during a specific time period. Using exploratory data analysis, we identified which cryptocurrencies to focus on and selected a few for further analysis. We implemented a machine learning model to predict price changes based on sentiment extracted from the text of news articles. Additionally, we conducted a time series analysis to further understand the relationship between news sentiment and cryptocurrency price movements.

What we seek to Address
Does historical data of BTC, ETH, status, or ratings influence this result?
How were cryptocurrencies trending during that period?
What were the top 10 cryptocurrencies and their market capitalization at that time?
Do the total traded Quantity and Close Price of the coin hold any sort of relation between them?
Which analysis model will be best for the analysis of the dataset?
Can we analyze price movements and trading volumes and give 7-day predictions?
